With the same starting parameters the newtions method could find the local minimum which was downhill from the starting parameters,
while the quasinewton metod have to construct the hessian while running the minimization, this leads to a few confused first steps for the quasinewton method.
Disclaimer: the quasinewton methos is capable of finding all the minima of the Himmelblau function, however, closer starting parameters are needed, while the newtons method seems to be able to always find the local minima closest to the starting parameters

ps. I have implemeted the starting parameters such, that they are controlled by the variable a, so if you wish you can increase the value of a to see how the quasinewton method starts finding random minia instead of the closest

Comparing with the Rosenbrock's valley function
newtons method
start guess:	         3          3 
awnser:		         1          1 
should be approx (1,1)	the Rosenbrock's valley function was called 430 times

quasi-newtons method
start guess:	         3          3 
awnser:		         1          1 
should be approx (1,1)	the Rosenbrock's valley function was called 448 times

Quasi-newtons method seems to get the wrong awnser if the starting parameters are too far from the minima, where as the newtons method using the hessian matrix can take any starting parameters and til get the right awnser
