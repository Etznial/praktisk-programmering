In this exam project I have implemented the Akima sub-spline as shown in the book, I have made a plot with a stepfunction to resemble figure 1.2 in the book
I have plottet the data points, Akima sub-spline and a quadratic spline for referance. The files where coppied from the spline interpolation exercise, where 
the quadratic spline already were implemented. 

Rateing: 8/10; I feel like I am forgetting something, but I cant put my finger on it.
